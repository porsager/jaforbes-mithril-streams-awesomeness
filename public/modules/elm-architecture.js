  The Mithril rewrite has streams.  This todo app was created using 
  an architecture made famous by the lanuage [Elm](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial)
  
  The core idea is you do not mutate state, you have an update function that
  accumulates state by responding to actions over time.
  
  In Elm you can define these Actions as part of the type system and get
  helpful hints when one of your functions doesn't handle all the possible code 
  paths.
  
  In JS we will just use a switch statement.  Types are cool, but we'll live.

  
  #### Source Code Dump
  
  This example isn't completely finished so I am just going to dump the source.
  Feel free to check out the project on [hyperdev](https://hyperdev.com/#!/project/honey-toucan) as well.
  
  
  This is the update function.  It accepts the existing state and an action.
  
  An action is just some data that gets sent down a stream when certain 
  events occur.
  
  Here is my schema for an action in this example:
  
      type Action = 
        { type: 'Remove' | 'Edit' | 'Add' | 'Toggle'
        , todo: Todo
        , event: Event 
        }
  
  Todo is simple as well:
  
      type Todo = 
        { text: string
        , done: boolean 
        }
        
  And Event is just a browser event.  We use it to grab input values.
  So the interface we rely on is:
  
      type Event = 
        { currentTarget: 
          {
            value: string
          }
        }
        
  It is a lot easier if you can rely on consistent interfaces.
  
  Let's look at \`update\`:
  
  It accepts an action and a list of todos.  We return a new list of todos.
  This is very different to traditional MVC where you would \`push\` into an array.
  We never mutate the state of todos manually, we define a relationship:
  
  \`Action -> Todo[]\`
  
  You might notice that update is a reducer
  
  \`\`\`js
  ${
    update.toString()
  }
  \`\`\`
  
  I don't like to use switches, and here I would use something else like 
  
  Ramda's [cond](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#cond) or 
  
  Union Type's [caseOn](https://github.com/paldepind/union-type)
  
  Or even a ternary.
  
  But I wanted to demo that nothing magic is going on.
  
  
  Let's look at the component itself.
  
  First we define some helpers for turning DOM events into Actions.
  Then we define some helper views.
  
  Some of these views are streams that depend on the model.
  
  Then we define our model as a reduction of actions.
  
  Then we make a final view stream and return it.
  
  Keeping the above in mind the source should be fairly readable on its own.
  
  \`\`\`js
  ${
    Main.toString()
  }
  \`\`\`

  return m.trust(
    marked(
      text
    )
  )

const ns = '.s'+Math.random().toString(32).slice(2,10)

// Normally I would style classes not elements, but I don't want to pepper
// the example with css when the example isn't about that.
const style = `

  ${ns} {
    min-height: 20em;
    margin: 1em;

  ${ns} button {
    opacity: 1; 
    transition: '1s';

    opacity: 0.5;
